# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Remembering which commands start with Object and which use the object name. I also kept forgetting the commas after key-value pairs.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I usually write down commands, which is helpful because like I said above, I'm bad at remembering how some of them are formatted. I also write an explanation of how the concept works in order to get it to stick in my head. When? I write notes as I'm reading the lesson.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I try to solve the problem in code first then google. For example when I didn't know how to reference a specific value in an object I tried formatting the command the same way it looked like I would to call a specific element in an array.
```
console.log(array[0])
```
I tried to do
```
console.log(Object.values(values[0]))
```
Which didn't work so I googled it and saw the proper formatting was
```
console.log(Object.values(values)[0])
```
So I try first, google second.
